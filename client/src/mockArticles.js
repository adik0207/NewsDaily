    title: 'More than a strongman? In India, coalition politics will be Modi’s third-term test.',
    summary: 'Having taken his oath and appointed his Cabinet, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi embarked on his third term in office this week. But all is not the same in Delhi. ',
    content: "During the recent general elections, Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party fell 32 seats short of the majority mark in India’s Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament, turning two regional parties into kingmakers. After 10 years of Mr. Modi wielding nearly absolute authority, this administration will rely heavily on the support of the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal United, whose leaders cosigned the new government but have also made it clear that they don’t agree with everything the BJP stands for. The coalition dynamics will test Mr. Modi’s political acumen as he navigates the diverse demands of his allies and party. The future of his government hinges on this balance, with major implications for Indian democracy. The BJP still holds significant power, but Zoya Hasan, professor emerita at the Centre for Political Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University, says the election verdict “marks a return to coalition politics.”She says it will be a challenge for the prime minister to temper his party’s Hindu nationalist agenda, noting the complete lack of Muslim appointees in his new Cabinet, and perhaps more so to let go of its centralized style of governance. Can Mr. Modi lead a coalition? Mr. Modi has thrice served as chief minister of India’s Gujarat state and twice as prime minister, all with a clear majority in the state assembly and Lok Sabha, respectively. Armed with a strong mandate, he’s had a leadership style characterized by decisiveness and an ability to push through his agenda with relative ease.",

    title: 'Cricket is having a moment in the US. Can it bowl over American audiences?',
    summary: 'The surprising victory of the United States over Pakistan in a World Cup game casts a spotlight on its rising popularity in the U.S. and significance to immigrant communities.',
    content: 'When the United States beat Pakistan in a World Cup cricket match in Texas last week, the upset stunned cricket watchers worldwide. Only a select audience has been aware of the growth of cricket in the U.S. in recent decades, and the excitement ignited a broader burst of interest that many cricketers hope will last.Around the world, cricket has long been a tool both for diplomacy and an outlet for expressing fraught relations between countries like India and Pakistan. But the surprise win against Pakistan spotlighted the fast-rising popularity of the sport within the U.S., which traces back to cross-cultural stories of immigrants from countries that embrace cricket.Adult and youth leagues exist all over the country, with hundreds of teams in some metro areas. Last week’s T20 World Cup match between the U.S. and Pakistan, and India’s subsequent win against Pakistan, drew max capacity crowds of 40,000 cumulatively, with attendees paying single ticket prices reaching into the thousands. This week, the much-anticipated match between the U.S. and India is expected to draw a sold-out crowd of 34,000 to a temporary stadium on Long Island, New York. Cricket’s fast-rising popularity in the U.S. is largely thanks to expats from South Asia and beyond, who are reveling in attention centered on the tournament, with some World Cup games hosted by the U.S. for the first time. The current enthusiasm is familiar to many Americans with roots in Southeast Asia, South Africa, Britain, or the Caribbean. But some hope it’s an indication of future growth. “There’s this kind of growing embracing of what has been a global sport except for the United States’ participation,” says Jay Coakley, a professor emeritus at University of Colorado, Colorado Springs who studies global migration and sports.Fans are excited to see cricket as an Olympic sport for the first time since 1900 at the 2028 games in Los Angeles. The new U.S. Major League Cricket, started by investments from tech leaders like Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, sold out its debut season games last year.',

    summary: 'US renewed a warning that it’s obligated to defend its close treaty ally a day after Filipino navy personnel were injured following clash with China in sea.',
    content: "The United States renewed a warning Tuesday that it’s obligated to defend its close treaty ally a day after Filipino navy personnel were injured and their supply boats damaged in one of the most serious confrontations between the Philippines and China in a disputed shoal in the South China Sea, officials said. China and the Philippines blamed each other for instigating Monday’s hostilities in the Second Thomas Shoal, which has been occupied by a small Filipino navy contingent aboard a grounded warship that's been closely watched by Chinese coast guard, navy and suspected militia ships in a yearslong territorial standoff. There is fear the disputes, long regarded as an Asian flashpoint, could escalate and pit the United States and China in a larger conflict. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell discussed China's actions with Philippine counterpart, Maria Theresa Lazaro, in a telephone call. Both agreed that China’s “dangerous actions threatened regional peace and stability,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.Campbell reaffirmed that the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty, which obligates Washington and Manila to help defend the other in major conflicts, “extends to armed attacks on Philippine armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft – including those of its coast guard – anywhere in the South China Sea,” according to Miller.",
